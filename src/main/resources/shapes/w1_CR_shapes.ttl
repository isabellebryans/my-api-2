# Need to do: pawn moves two on first move - > done
# Pawn move -> done
# colour, change pawn move -> done
# moved to cant be king -> done
# if piece captured, it must be the other colour to the capturer piece -> done


# to do :
# - captureOtherColour (need to do for ts as well)


# Knowing
# BS + PI + status + move

# Can validate:
# The piece moved must be moved into a position that is empty, or not
# The move must be a legal move depending on piece moved
# - King cannot be captured
# where they move is a tile
# Piece moved must not be in same position as previous

# Can't validate
# - Piece captured is indeed captured, can only see this in the next window bc there'll be two pieces in one tile
# - If a black piece is moved, then it must capture a white piece -> could do ith parql
# - only one piece moved at one time stamp
# - if piece captured, can't see if it is then out
# captured?

# General move
# the piece moved must adhere to exactly one of the piece move shapes
